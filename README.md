# COVID19-SELF-ISOLATION-MONITORING-SYSTEM
C++ PROJECT (OBJECT ORIENTED) This is a system which will periodically accept the data provided to it about a self-isolated COVID19 suspect who s kept under observation. Since there are a lot of individuals who haven't tested positive for the virus but are kept under isolation ,any other person coming in contact with him possesses high risk . Let it be even doctors or nurses. Thus,this system will self monitor the suspect's health measures like heart beat,blood pressure,temperature etc and immediately display the unnatural patterns .
